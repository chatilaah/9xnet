9xNET is an open-source user interface implementation of Windows 95, written entirely in .NET

Despite the project being at early stages, I thought it would be great to share my latest work.

## Privacy Policy

The product does NOT collect nor track nor link any user data. It only utilizes external dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) or executable (EXEs) file(s) that are provided within the Microsoft™ Windows™ installation media to provide an authentic classic Windows experience.

## Current Features

- Context menus
- Draggable icons (still buggy)
- Start menu (incomplete)
- Rectangle selection

## History

The project (formerly codenamed "Eternal95") was started in April 2019, but had a short lifespan due to commitment problems. It was eventually branded "Dolly 95" to reflect a popular story about a cloned sheep called [Dolly](https://dolly.roslin.ed.ac.uk/facts/the-life-of-dolly/index.html).

<!-- As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1] -->

> Early versions of Dolly 95 binaries are only available upon request.

## Legal notice

9xNET does NOT include any single Microsoft™ Windows™ resource file within the source code. I shall not be held responsible for including such proprietary files.

## Installation

<!-- > Before beginning, make sure to mount or insert a legitimate copy of Microsoft Windows 95 CD-ROM. Without the CD-ROM, 9xNET could not run. -->

<br>

1. Download and install .NET 6.0 SDK for Windows

> https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

<br>

3. Run the project

> Navigate to the source root directory using Command Prompt or Powershell and type the following:

```

**Enjoy testing my latest work!**
